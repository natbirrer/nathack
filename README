This is a roguelike game similar to Nethack written in C++, and based on all of my favorite genres of fantasy.

TO DO:
------
+ set up git repo
+ implement ncurses boilerplate
+ make a way to import maps (from text files?)
+ make a draw map function
+ make movement functional
+ fix minor cursor placement issue
+ add color
- add some menus at the beginning and some character attributes
- map is read in two places - maybe consolidate this/make it nicer
- add more maps
- add a way to go from map to map
+ make map dimensions constants
- make interface with environment in an object-oriented way
- clean up and organize everything

global: map size
    environment.h: read map, environment object definitions
        environment.cpp: environment object implementations
    characters.h: character object definitions
        characters.cpp: character object implementations
        
    process input in function in a header
