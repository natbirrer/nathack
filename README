This is a roguelike game similar to Nethack written in C++, and based on all of my favorite genres of fantasy.

TO DO:
------
+ set up git repo
+ implement ncurses boilerplate
+ make a way to import maps (from text files?)
+ make a draw map function
+ make movement functional
+ fix minor cursor placement issue
+ add color
- add some menus at the beginning and some character attributes
- map is read in two places - maybe consolidate this/make it nicer
- add more maps
- add a way to go from map to map
