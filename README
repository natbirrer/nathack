This is a roguelike game similar to Nethack written in C++, and based on all of my favorite genres of fantasy.

TO DO:
------
+ set up git repo
- make header file for classes
- make classes for: main character, monster, wall, floor?, objects
+ implement ncurses boilerplate
- make a way to import maps (from text files?)
- make a draw map function
